Breathe
=======

This is an extension to reStructuredText and Sphinx to be able to read and
render the Doxygen xml output.

Download
--------

Breathe is available from github and `PyPI, the Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/breathe>`_

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available `here <http://breathe.readthedocs.org/>`_. Thank
you to the people running `Read the Docs <http://readthedocs.org>`_ for such an
excellent service.

The source for the documentation is in the ``documentation`` folder if you want
to built it and read it locally.

Testing
-------

Breathe doesn't have a set of tests at the moment. The documentation does a good
job of running the different parts of the Breathe functionality but there is
nothing to check that the output is appropriate.

To build the documentation, run ``make`` in the root of the project. 

This will run doxygen over the example code and then run the Breathe
documentation. View the results at::

   documentation/build/html/index.html

Requirements
------------

Development is currently done with:
 
- Python 2.7.4
- Docutils 0.11
- Sphinx 1.2.2
- Doxygen 1.8.4

Doxygen 1.5.1 seems to produce xml with repeated sections which causes Breathe
some confusion. Not sure when this was resolved but it might be best to go for
the latest possible.

Mailing List
------------

There is a mailing list available thanks to `LibreList <http://librelist.com>`_::

    breathe@librelist.com

The archives are available `here <http://librelist.com/browser/breathe/>`_.

Examples
--------

Examples of Breathe used by other projects:

- `cppformat <http://cppformat.github.io/doc/latest/index.html>`_

If you have an example you would like listed here, please make a github issue
with the details.

Change Log
----------

- Changes since the last release

  - Improved ``:members:`` implementation to handle inner classes properly.

  - Updated ``doxygenstruct`` to share the ``doxygenclass`` implementation path
    which grants it the options from ``doxygenclass`` directive.

  - Added ``:outline:`` option support to ``doxygengroup`` &
    ``doxygennamespace`` directives.

  - Added ``doxygennamespace`` directive.

  - Added ``:undoc-members:`` option to ``doxygenclass`` & ``doxygengroup``
    directives.

  - **Breaking change**: Removed ``:sections:`` option for ``doxygenclass`` &
    ``doxygengroup`` directives and replaced it with ``:members:``,
    ``:protected-members:`` and ``:private-members:``, and changed
    ``breathe_default_sections`` config variable to ``breathe_default_members``.
    This is designed to more closely match the Sphinx autodoc functionality and
    interface.

- Breathe v2.0.0

  - Add compare script for checking changes to documentation caused by changes
    in the implementation.

  - Switched to ``https`` reference for MathJax Javascript.

  - **Breaking change**: Change ``autodoxygen*`` directives to require
    explicitly declared source files in the ``conf.py`` rather than attempting
    to detect them from the directive arguments.

  - Switch documentation hosting to ReadTheDocs.org.

  - **Breaking change**: Switch to assuming all relative paths are relative to
    the directory holding the ``conf.py`` file. Previously, it would assume they
    were relative to the user's current working directory. This breaks projects
    which use separate build & source directories.

  - Add ``doxygenunion`` directive.

  - Add ``doxygengroup`` directive.

  - Add support for lists in the output. They were previously ignored.

  - Updated implementation to use the docutils nodes that Sphinx does where
    possible.

- Breathe v1.2.0

  - Change log not recorded.
